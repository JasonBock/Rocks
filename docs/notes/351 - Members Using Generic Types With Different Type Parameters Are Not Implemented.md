* Look to see if there's any way to get a list of members from a type that can be overriden from Roslyn. (That would make things so much easier in the long run)
* We need to find a way to handle parameter matching "correctly" for this case. Look at the symbol original definition type kind. If it's a method, we don't care, but if it's a type, we DO care. Meaning, look at something like this: `namedLeft.TypeArguments[0].OriginalDefinition.ContainingSymbol.Kind`. If `Kind` is a `Method` for both, then we don't care (or maybe we just positionally, look at the `MatchWhenMethodsDifferByGenericParameterName()` test), but if it's something like `NamedType`, then if the names are different, that IS different.
